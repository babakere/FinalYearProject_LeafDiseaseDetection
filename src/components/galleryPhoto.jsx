        "Black Rot, caused by the fungus Guignardia bidwellii, mainly affects the fruit but can also cause lesions on leaves. It's identified by circular brown lesions on the leaves that have a ring of black dots. Early identification and removal of infected plant material, along with the appropriate use of fungicides, are key to management.",

        "Black Measles, also known as Esca, is a complex disease involving fungi that live inside the wood of grapevines. Symptoms on leaves manifest as yellow and white chlorotic spots, which later turn into necrotic areas. Effective treatment involves careful vineyard management and sometimes the application of protective wound paint on pruning cuts.",
